# Overview of Maven

Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It helps manage project dependencies, build processes, and project documentation. Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file to define project structure, dependencies, and build configurations.

## The Concept of Vulnerability in Maven

In the context of Maven, a vulnerability refers to a **security flaw** or **weakness** in the software components (artifacts) that a project depends on. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of the application, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.

## The Role of API's

APIs **(Application Programming Interfaces)** play a crucial role in Maven by allowing developers to interact with various services and tools.

API's are like **Plugins**...

(*For instance, Maven can use APIs to **fetch dependencies** from remote repositories, **integrate** with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and **communicate** with security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in project dependencies*)

In a broader context, APIs enable different software systems to interact seamlessly. For example, in an application like WhatsApp, APIs allow the app to send and receive messages, connect to servers, and interact with other services securely and efficiently. Similarly, in Maven, APIs facilitate communication between the build tool and external systems, making automation and integration possible.

## The Maven Global Server and Maven Local Repository

The **[Maven Global Server](https://search.maven.org/)**, often referred to as the **Maven Central Repository**, is a vast repository of Java libraries and artifacts that are publicly available for developers to use in their projects. It serves as a central hub where developers can publish and share their libraries, making it easier for others to find and integrate these dependencies into their own projects.

When a developer specifies a dependency in their Maven .POM file, Maven automatically searches the Global Server to download the required.

The **Maven Local Repository** is a directory on the developer's machine where Maven stores downloaded dependencies and project artifacts locally, allowing Maven to reuse these files for future builds without needing to re-download them from the Global Server.

## Setting up Maven

- A prerequisite for using Maven is to have a compatible JDK installed (e.g., JDK 8 or later).
- Download and install **[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)** (prefer the .zip file extension).
- Add environment variables for JDK and Maven to the build directory.

## How to add Maven and Java to Path Variables (On Windows)

1. Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Select "Edit the system environment variables."
3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. In the Environment Variables window, under the "System variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to your JDK's `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-xx\bin`).
6. Click "New" again and add the path to your Maven `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\apache-maven-xx\bin`).
