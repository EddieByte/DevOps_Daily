# Generating an Artifact using Maven:

An artifact in Maven is a file, typically a JAR (Java ARchive), that is produced as the output of a build process. Artifacts are the compiled code and resources that make up a software project and can be shared and reused across different projects.

The process begins with source code, which is usually stored in a version control system such as GitHub. This source code is then compiled by Maven during the build process. The result of this compilation is the artifact, which can then be distributed or reused in other projects.

## Steps to Create a Maven Project:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
3. Run the following Maven command to create a new project:
 ```
 mvn archetype:generate 
-DgroupId=com.example 
-DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

 ```
Replace `com.example` with your desired group ID and `my-app` with your desired artifact ID.

4. Navigate into the newly created project directory

# Folder Structure:

There will be a couple of files in each of these folders :

1. .mvn
2. src
3. pom.xml
# Folder Structure:

There will be a couple of newly generated files in the folder which are:

1. .mvn
   - Contains Maven wrapper files
   - wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
   - wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties 

2. src
   - main/java - Contains application source code
   - main/resources - Contains application resources like properties files
   - test/java - Contains test source code
   - test/resources - Contains test resources

3. pom.xml
   - Project Object Model file
   - Contains project configuration and dependencies
   - Defines build settings, plugins and project metadata
   - Core configuration file for Maven projects
