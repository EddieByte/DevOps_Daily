# Generating an Artifact using Maven:

An artifact in Maven is a file, typically a JAR (Java ARchive), that is produced as the output of a build process. Artifacts are the compiled code and resources that make up a software project and can be shared and reused across different projects.

The process begins with source code, which is usually stored in a version control system such as GitHub. This source code is then compiled by Maven during the build process. The result of this compilation is the artifact, which can then be distributed or reused in other projects.

## Steps to Create a Maven Project:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
3. Run the following Maven command to create a new project:
 
`mvn archetype:generate` 

`DgroupId=com.example` 

`DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false`

Replace `com.example` with your desired group ID and `my-app` with your desired artifact ID.

4. Navigate into the newly created project directory

# Folder Structure:

There will be a couple of files in each of these folders :

1. .mvn
2. src
3. pom.xml

Up next, you need to modify the pom.xml file to add your dependencies, depending on the particular application build. These dependencies download api's to help the application communicate with other services.

# Building the Project:

To build the project and generate the artifact, run the following command in the terminal from the root directory of your project:
 
`mvn package`

The above command compiles the source code, runs tests, and packages the compiled code into a JAR file. The resulting artifact will be located in the `target` directory within your project folder.

# Locating the Artifact:

After running the `mvn package` command, navigate to the `target` directory inside your project folder. You should find a file named `my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (the name may vary based on your artifact ID and version specified in the `pom.xml` file).

This JAR file is your Maven artifact, which can be used as a dependency in other projects or deployed to a server.

5. Open the `pom.xml` file in a text editor and add any necessary dependencies for your project.

6. Save the `pom.xml` file.
