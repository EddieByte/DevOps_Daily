# Jenkins Workflow

## Overview

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Basic Workflow Steps

### 1. Source Code Management

- Connect to version control (Git, SVN, etc.)
- Configure repository URL and credentials
- Set up branch specifications

### 2. Build Triggers

- Poll SCM for changes
- Webhook triggers from repository
- Scheduled builds (cron syntax)
- Manual triggers

### 3. Build Environment

- Set up build agents/nodes
- Configure environment variables
- Install required tools and dependencies

### 4. Build Steps

- Compile source code
- Run unit tests
- Generate artifacts
- Code quality analysis

### 5. Post-Build Actions

- Archive artifacts
- Publish test results
- Send notifications
- Deploy to staging/production

## Pipeline Types

### Freestyle Projects

- Simple, GUI-based configuration
- Good for basic CI/CD workflows

### Pipeline as Code

- Jenkinsfile in repository
- Version-controlled pipeline definition
- Declarative or Scripted syntax

## Best Practices

- Use Pipeline as Code
- Implement proper error handling
- Secure credentials management
- Regular backup of Jenkins configuration
- Monitor Build Performance
